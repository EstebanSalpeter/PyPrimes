# PyPrimes
Library of Python functions to work with large prime numbers
My goal is to test an algoritm I've constructed which I expect to be faster than the factorizing method (Erathostenes). It aims to take advantage of the lower computational cost of multiplication over division, which in the domain of large numbers should be significant.
You are free to use it but remember me on the credits!
